.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bgpscanner
is a performance oriented utility to parse MRT RIB
snapshots and updates, with filtering capability.
The
.B bgpscanner
utility reads one or more MRT snapshot or updates, applies a set of filtering
rules to every packet and dumps each one of them respecting the specified criteria in a human
readable format. Packets discarded by the rules are not printed.
By default,
.B bgpscanner
reads the data from its standard input and dumps to the
standard output, and performs no filtering.
This behavior can be changed with the appropriate arguments.
While reading each MRT dump,
.B bgpscanner
reconstructs the original BGP packet sequence and applies the filtering rules to each one of them.
The filtering process is divided in different phases:
.IP
.PD 0
.IP 1 5
Filtering by feeder, which may discard a packet based on the feeder that announce
.IP 2 5
Filtering by attributes, which may discard a packet based on the presence of specific attributes of interest.
.IP 3 5
Filtering by AS PATH, which may discard a packet based on the routes it contains.
.IP 4 5
Filtering by networks, which may discard a packet based on the networks contained in its NLRI and WITHDRAWN fields.
.PD
.PP
The phases are applied in sequence, and multiple criteria may be specified for each one of them, resulting
in ORing toghether multiple conditions. See the \fBEXAMPLE\fR section for examples of such logic.

.SS Operands
The following operands are supported:
.TP
.B FILE
A pathname of an input file. If no file operands are specified, the standard input is used.
If a file is '-',
.B bgpscanner
shall read from the standard input at that point in the sequence.
.B bgpscanner
does not close and reopen standard input when it is referenced in this way, but accepts multiple occurrences of '-' as a file operand.
See the \fBINPUT FILES\fR section for details on the supported file formats.
.
.PD
.PP
.SS Exit Status
The following exit values are returned:
.TP
.B 0
All input data was scanned successfully, file operands contained no errors and output has been produced correctly.
.TP
.B >0
Errors were detected in input data, an write error occurred, or an unexpected error occurred (such as out of memory errors).
.
.PD
.PP
.SH STDIN
The standard input shall be used only if no file operands are specified, or if a file operand is '\-'.
Note that whenever \fBbgpscanner\fR reads from standard input, the input data is assumed to be uncompressed, whereas input files may come
in compressed formats. See the \fBINPUT FILES\fR section.
.
.PD
.PP
.SH INPUT FILES
.B bgpscanner
supports the most common MRT dump formats, either in raw uncompressed form, or compressed using
.IR gzip (1)
,
.IR bzip2 (1)
or
.IR xz (1)
performing the appropriate decompression on the fly.
The pathname extension is used to determine the compression algorithm.
.
.PD
.SH STDOUT
The standard output shall contain the sequence of bytes read from the input files.
Nothing else shall be written to the standard output.
If the standard output is a regular file, and is the same file as any of the input file operands, the implementation may treat this as an error.
.
.PD
.SH STDERR
The standard error is used only for diagnostic messages and error reporting.
Any packet dumping happens exclusively on standard output.
.
.PD
.PP
.SH AS PATH MATCH EXPRESSIONS
AS PATH match expressions (accepted by
.B \-p
and
.B \-P
options) are defined by a simplified format
based on typical conventions estabilished by the POSIX regular expressions.
The most basic example is the generic AS PATH matching, an expression such as:
.br
.B bgpscanner\ \-p\ "1\ 2"
.RE
matches any packet whose AS PATH crosses link 1 2. The 1 2 link may appear anywhere in the AS PATH.
The expression can be arbitrarily complex, for example:
.br
.B bgpscanner\ \-p\ "1\ 2\ 3\ 4\ 5\ 6\ 7\ 8"
.RE
matches any packet with the corresponding AS subsequence appearing anywhere in its AS PATH.
A '?' (question mark) can be placed anywhere in the expression to signal the fact that any AS number may
appear in that position, for example:
.br
.B bgpscanner\ \-p\ "1\ ?\ 3"
.RE
matches any packet whose AS PATH contains a subsequence of length 3, whose first AS is 1 and the last one is 3.
.P
The matching expressions may be constrained to operate to the beginning or the end of the AS PATH.
By prepending '^' (caret) to the expression, the following AS numbers are required to appear at the beginning of the path.
For example:
.br
.B bgpscanner\ \-p\ "^1\ 2"
.RE
matches any packet whose AS PATH starts with the link 1 2.
In a similar fashion, the expression can be forced to match at the end of the path by appending a '$' (dollar sign) at the end of it.
.br
.B bgpscanner\ \-p\ "1\ 2$"
.RE
matches any packet whose AS PATH ends with the link 1 2.
A '?' may still be used to match any AS number in the corresponding position, for example:
.br
.B bgpscanner\ \-p\ "1\ ?$"
.RE
matches any packet whose AS PATH is ending with the second to last AS number being 1.
The '^' and '$' symbols may be used to create exact matches, such as:
.br
.B bgpscanner\ \-p\ "^1\ 2\ 3\ 4$"
.RE
matches any packet whose AS PATH is exactly 1 2 3 4.
.br
.B bgpscanner\ \-p\ "^1\ 2\ ?\ 4$"
.RE
matches any packet whose AS PATH starts with 1 2 and ends with 4, but may have any AS number
in the second to last position.
A '*' (star) may be used to match zero or more AS numbers in the position where it appears.
Note that if the intended usage is to match \fBone\fR or more AS numbers, then a '?' symbol
should be used before the '*'. For example:
.br
.B bgpscanner\ \-p\ "^1\ 2\ *\ 4$"
.RE
matches any packet whose AS PATH starts with 1 2, then contains \fBzero\fR or more AS numbers and terminates with 4.
.br
.B bgpscanner\ \-p\ "^1\ 2\ ?\ *\ 4$"
.RE
matches any packet whose AS PATH starts with 1 2, then contains \fBone\fR or more AS numbers and terminates with 4.
The metacharacters explained above may be mixed to create arbitrarily complex expressions.

.PP
.SH FILTER TEMPLATE FILES
A number of options allows for variants specifying a file to read values (for example the
.B \-e
option provides a
.B \-E
variant to read each network from a file). This provides means to create
filter templates that may be slightly customized by additional direct command line arguments.
For example
.B bgpscanner
may be used to filter a certain set of networks that are always interesting, plus a number of varying
networks. To avoid typing the entire set of networks, it can be written to a \fBtemplate file\fR and
loaded using the appropriate option:
.br
.B bgpscanner\ \-E\ template.txt\ \-e\ "192.65.121.0/24"
.TP
The template file is expected to contain a space separated list of tokens in the same format as
the ones expected by the non-template variant of the same option. Note that newlines are still considered
spaces.
Comments may be freely inserted in the file by prepending them with the '#' (hash) character, anything following
the '#' is ignored up to the next newline.
Tokens containing spaces may be enclosed in '"' (quotes) to preserve them.
Template files support the usual C-style character escape sequences.
